# Introduction
This is an Android online restaurant ordering app. User may register and login into their account and starts online ordering food. The app communicates to a set of REST APIs exposed by server. A sample back-end providing this service can be found at [my other GitHub repo here.](https://github.com/CristianoYL/RestaurantAppAPI)
# Configurations
## IDE
The project is developed using **Android Studio 3.0**. It is recommended that you use **Android Studio** instead of other IDEs for simpler project import. [You may download Android Studio from the official website here](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html).

## Dependencies
This service relies on serveral other services as well. For example, it uses [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-api/) for location services and maps, [Gson](https://sites.google.com/site/gson/gson-user-guide) for data serialization, more specificly, for jsonifying data, and [Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs) for live credit card charges etc.

Since **Android Studio** uses **gradle build**, you don't need to worry about dependencies when importing the code.
